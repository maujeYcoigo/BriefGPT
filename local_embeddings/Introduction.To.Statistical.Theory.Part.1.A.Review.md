The book is divided into 14 chapters, each focusing on a specific topic of statistical theory. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of statistics, such as population, sample, parameter, statistic, data types and levels of measurement. The second chapter deals with the concept of probability and its rules, such as addition rule, multiplication rule, conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. The third chapter explains the concept of random variables and their properties, such as expected value, variance and standard deviation. The fourth chapter discusses the different types of probability distributions, such as discrete and continuous distributions, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, normal distribution and exponential distribution. The fifth chapter covers the topic of sampling and sampling distributions, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling and sampling distribution of sample mean and sample proportion. The sixth chapter introduces the concept of estimation and its methods, such as point estimation, interval estimation and properties of estimators. The seventh chapter presents the concept of hypothesis testing and its steps, such as null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, test statistic, critical region, p-value and types of errors. The eighth chapter explains the different types of tests for population mean and proportion, such as z-test, t-test and chi-square test. The ninth chapter covers the topic of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and its applications, such as one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA and factorial ANOVA. The tenth chapter deals with the topic of correlation and regression analysis and its methods, such as scatter diagram, correlation coefficient, simple linear regression model, multiple linear regression model and coefficient of determination. The eleventh chapter discusses the topic of non-parametric tests and their applications, such as sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The twelfth chapter covers the topic of index numbers and their types, such as simple index numbers, weighted index numbers and consumer price index. The thirteenth chapter explains the concept of time series analysis and its components, such as trend, seasonal variation, cyclical variation and irregular variation. The fourteenth chapter presents the concept of quality control charts and their types, such as x-bar chart, R-chart and p-chart.
 
Introduction To Statistical Theory Part 1 by Prof Sher Muhammad Chaudhry and Dr. Shahid Kamal is a comprehensive and well-written textbook that provides a solid foundation for students who want to learn the fundamentals of statistical theory. It is suitable for students who have some background in mathematics and calculus. It is also useful for teachers who want to teach statistics in an engaging and effective way.
